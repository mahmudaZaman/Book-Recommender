# Movie Recommender

## Problem Statement

The Movie Recommender project aims to create a sophisticated movie recommendation system that enhances user experiences by suggesting films based on their viewing history and personal preferences. This project leverages collaborative filtering techniques and showcases my expertise in machine learning and recommendation systems.

## Dataset

For this project, I utilized the MovieLens dataset, a comprehensive collection of movie ratings and user data. This dataset serves as the foundation for building a personalized movie recommendation system.

## AWS Integration

The Movie Recommender project seamlessly integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to leverage advanced tools and capabilities:

- **SageMaker Collaborative Filtering**: I implemented collaborative filtering techniques using AWS SageMaker. This approach ensures that movie recommendations are fine-tuned and tailored to individual user profiles, optimizing the user experience.

- **Amazon DynamoDB**: User preferences and movie ratings are efficiently stored and managed in Amazon DynamoDB. This cloud-based database solution enables quick access to user data and streamlines the recommendation process.

## How to Get Started
