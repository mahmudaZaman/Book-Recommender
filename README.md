# Book Recommender

## Problem Statement

The Book Recommender project aims to create a sophisticated book recommendation system that enhances user experiences by suggesting books based on their personal preferences. This project leverages collaborative filtering techniques and showcases my expertise in machine learning and recommendation systems.

## Dataset

For this project, I utilized the Book Recommendation Dataset from Kaggle, a comprehensive collection of Users, Books, and Rating data. This dataset serves as the foundation for building a personalized movie recommendation system.

## Method

This project presents a Collaborative Filtering Book Recommender System using cosine similarity to analyze user-book interactions. The system, integrated into a Streamlit interface, allows users to input a book title, and in turn, receives recommendations for five similar books based on their preferences. Developed in Python, the project aims to offer a personalized reading experience, helping users discover new books aligned with their interests through collaborative filtering techniques and an intuitive user interface.
